**README**

  FresherFriend is an application designed to help first-year UoB students connect with other students, both before entering 
  University accomodation, and afterwards. Users can join group chats based on interests, and are automatically put in to a
  group chat based on the flat that they have been allocated. There is also a profile feature on the site, so that users can
  display their interests and personal information.


**BUILD STATUS**
  
  FresherFriend is still in its development stage, and as such the current functionality is simply meant as a demonstration,
  rather than a fully-working app. Users are able to log-in, but new accounts are unable to be created. Alongside this,
  groups assigned to users may not be accurate to their preferences, and chat history is not stored. Progress on our
  application will be documented regularly here.


**TECH**
  FresherFriend makes use of React (https://reactjs.org/) for the front end, Node (https://nodejs.org/) for the backend, and
  PostgreSQL (https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database.
