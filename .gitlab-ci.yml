# This is a sample GitLab CI/CD configuration file that should run without any modifications.
# It demonstrates a basic 3 stage CI/CD pipeline. Instead of real tests or scripts,
# it uses echo commands to simulate the pipeline execution.
# services:
#   - postgres:latest

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - pre-deploy
  - deploy
